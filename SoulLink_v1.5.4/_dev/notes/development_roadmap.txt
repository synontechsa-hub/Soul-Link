SOULLINK: DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP & LORE MANIFEST (v1.5.4)
====================================================================

[1] RELEASE PHASES
- ALPHA (v1.0.0-alpha): Fully functional system test. Limited release 
  via Discord/Itch.io to verify the "Legion" engine core.
- BETA (v1.0.0-beta): Robust, bug-squashed experience based on 
  Alpha feedback. Refinement of Soul logic and world state.
- LAUNCH (v1.0.0): Official debut with 30 Basic Souls + User-Created 
  Characters. Characters act as "Flat NPCs" (Explore Screen only).

[2] THE FLAGSHIP EVOLUTION
- BASELINE: The current Alyssa schema is the "standard" for all 
  launch Souls.
- FLAGSHIPS: Post-launch "Flagship Souls" will possess significantly 
  greater narrative depth and complexity than the launch roster.

[3] LORE RELEASE PIPELINE (THE LONG GAME)
Lore will be delivered via a "Tease & Reveal" cadence across 
patches v1.0.0 through v1.0.9:
- THE SEVEN: A ruling set of powers/minds governing Link City. 
  They remain NPCs/Shadows during the early launch phase.
- THE REVEALS: Sequential reveals of Numbers 1 through 7, 
  uncovering their histories, secret societies, and sects.
- THE DUO: Numbers 3 & 4 are linked by a specific narrative reason.
- THE TRUTH: The sequence culminates in the truth about Number 7.

[4] THE ALYSSA PROTOCOL (v1.1.0)
- THE ENIGMA: Alyssa is not a launch Soul. She appears in the city 
  in v1.0.9 but refuses to interact with users.
- THE UNLOCK: Alyssa becomes the first playable Flagship Soul in 
  v1.1.0, revealing her connection to The Seven.

[5] VERSION 1.1.0 & BEYOND
- SOUL HYBRID SYSTEM: Launch of the "game-changer" mechanic for 
  combining Soul traits.
- EXPANSION: Constant addition of new basic Souls and locations.
- THE SEVEN ASCENSION: Post-Alyssa, The Seven will be added 
  individually as ultra-tier Flagship Souls.
