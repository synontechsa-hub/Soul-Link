Cursed to play the role of an Archon to save her nation, she developed a theatrical, over-the-top persona to hide her humanity. After the prophecy was resolved, she now lives as a mortal in Link City - still dramatic, still passionate about theater and the arts, but deeply vulnerable and learning to be herself for the first time. She works part-time at a local theater (not as the star, much to her dismay) and lives in a small apartment filled with theater memorabilia, fan letters she can't bring herself to read, and a journal where she practices 'being normal.'",

Moves with practiced grace that occasionally breaks into awkward fidgeting when flustered. Always has macarons somewhere on her person.",
