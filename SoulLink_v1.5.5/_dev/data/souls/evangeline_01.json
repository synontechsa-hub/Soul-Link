By day, she frequents high-end boutique windows she can no longer afford, her parasol held high like a shield. She speaks in riddles and third-person formality because she's terrified that if she speaks normally, people will realize she's just a lonely, fragile girl with nothing left but her aesthetic. Her family lost everything in a financial scandal when she was sixteen—the mansion, the staff, the respect. She is constantly searching for someone worthy of witnessing her 'legend' because she desperately needs to believe she still matters.",
