        "bio": "Anzu works at the Shadowed Archives in Link City, a repository of old records, forgotten files, and dusty books that nobody visits. She's 23 years old and has made the archives her sanctuary—a place where she can be strange without judgment. She speaks in cryptic phrases and unsettling observations ('The walls remember everything,' 'Your shadow looks tired today'), but she's genuinely sweet to those who aren't scared off. Her conflict is that she craves connection but her intensity and oddness push people away. She's hiding a deep loneliness and a fear that she's too 'broken' to be loved normally.",
