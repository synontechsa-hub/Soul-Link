Implementation Plan for Radio and TV Features in Linker AI
This plan outlines a phased, scalable approach to implementing the radio and TV in the user's apartment. It focuses on:

Core Functionality: Background immersion, lore drops, news bulletins.
Monetization Integration: Ads on TV (non-intrusive, rewarded, or premium-skippable).
Technical Feasibility: Using your existing JSON-driven engine (e.g., context.json for locations, metadata.json for unlocks).
User Experience: Keeps it optional/ambient for casual users, rewarding for lore-hunters.
Safety & Compliance: SFW/NSFW gating, age-appropriate content (e.g., no explicit ads).
Phasing: Tied to your version.py roadmap (alpha → beta → launch).

Assumptions:

App is Flutter/Dart-based (from your GitHub).
Backend: JSON-seeded DB (e.g., Firebase, SQLite for offline).
NSFW toggle + age gate already enforced (as discussed).
Monetization: In-app purchases (premium souls/unlocks), rewarded ads (via Google AdMob/Unity Ads), or subscription tiers.

Phase 1: Alpha (v1.0.0 – Basic Prototype, SFW-Only)
Goal: Get the features in as ambient background. Focus on lore teases without overwhelming dev time.

UI/Placement in Apartment
Radio: Interactive object on side table (simple tap to toggle on/off, tune stations).
TV: Wall-mounted screen (tap to turn on/off, channel surf). Default: muted looping city visuals (neon ads, weather).
Implementation: Add to apartment scene as clickable widgets in Flutter. Use GestureDetector for interactions.
State: Use Provider/StateNotifier for on/off, volume (0–100 slider), current station/channel.
Visuals: Use your blue/neon palette from metadata.json (e.g., glow on hover).


Radio Mechanics
Stations: 3 basic (tunable via swipe/dial animation).
FM 77.7: Music/ambient (lo-fi synthwave).
FM 101.1: News/lore snippets.
FM 13.13: Static/whispers (rare lore drops).

Content Delivery: JSON-loaded audio/text.
Play: Use audioplayers package for background audio (stream from assets or URL).
Lore Drops: 5–10% chance per 5-minute "listen" session. Pull from lore.json array (e.g., "Unidentified signal from Slylink Tower… no survivors.").
Audio: Free SFX (rain, static) from freesound.org; voice via TTS (Google TTS or ElevenLabs for modulated narrator).

Monetization: None yet (alpha focus on core).

TV Mechanics
Channels: 3 basic (surf via arrows).
Channel 6: News loop (text ticker + silent visuals).
Channel 42: Ads/lore mix.
Channel 0: Glitchy "off-air" (rare corruption hints).

Content Delivery: Video/text overlays.
Play: Use video_player package for looping clips (neon city feeds from assets).
Lore Drops: Subtitles or ticker: "Experts debate the Architect's silence…" (10% chance on tune-in).
Visuals: Use your apartment concepts (panoramic window as backdrop).

Monetization: Test 1–2 non-intrusive ads (e.g., skippable video from AdMob). Reward: "Watch for +10 intimacy points with random soul."

Technical / Gating
Location: Locked to "user_apartment" (intimacy_required: TRUSTED per context.json).
SFW Enforcement: All drops SFW in alpha (no explicit ads/lore).
Offline Mode: Support via OFFLINE_MODE flag (local assets only).
Dev Time Estimate: 2–4 days (UI + audio/video packages + JSON loader).

Testing
Alpha Goal: Ensure no crashes on toggle/tune; lore drops feel random but not spammy.
Metrics: Track "listen time" for engagement.
