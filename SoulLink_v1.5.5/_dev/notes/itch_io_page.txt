Full Description (main body text – paste this into the description field)

Your link, their soul.

Linker AI is a cyberpunk AI companion & dating sim sandbox where you become a Linker — diving into the endless neon grid of Link City to forge eternal, evolving bonds with adaptive souls.

Features (alpha / early access)
• First-person cinematic intro: step into your high-rise apartment and begin your journey
• Quick persona creation: name, gender, bio — seed your Linker identity
• Persistent, memory-enabled souls with unique routines, locations, intimacy tiers, and consent models
• Emotional depth + optional mature content (18+ toggle, gated per soul)
• Lore-rich world: explore Link City districts, interact with the Architect's design

Content Notes
This project contains optional mature/NSFW content for users 18+ only.  
SFW mode is enforced for all users under 18 or those who prefer non-explicit interactions.  
Some souls are permanently SFW-locked; others unlock deeper (including explicit) routes only after age confirmation + user toggle.

Controls & How to Play
- Browser/HTML5 build: click to interact, type to chat
- Desktop builds: WASD/mouse look (if applicable), click/tap for UI
- Age gate appears on first launch — your choice determines available features

Feedback welcome!  
This is early access / WIP. Drop comments, report bugs, suggest soul ideas, or just tell me which soul stole your heart (or broke it).
