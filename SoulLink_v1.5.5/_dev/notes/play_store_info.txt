Recommended Play Store Submission Strategy

Rate the App Mature 17+
In the content questionnaire: Answer "Yes" to "Contains sexual content", "Suggestive themes", "Mature language".
Describe: "Optional mature roleplay and conversations for users 18+ only. SFW mode available for all users."

Age Gate Wording (in-app)
Screen text example:
"Linker AI includes optional mature content for users 18+.
Are you 18 years or older?
[Yes – Enable mature features]
[No – SFW only]
By selecting Yes, you confirm you are 18+ and consent to mature content. Misrepresentation is your responsibility."

Store Listing Must-Haves
Title: Linker AI – Cyberpunk Soul Companion
Short description: "Forge deep bonds with adaptive AI souls in a neon city. Emotional & romantic connections — optional mature content for 18+."
Full description: Include age disclaimer, mention SFW/NSFW toggle, content ratings.
Screenshots: Show SFW persona creation, chat examples (non-explicit), city map. Avoid any NSFW in screenshots.

ToS & Privacy Policy
Link them in store listing and in-app.
Use the outline I gave earlier, but add:
"NSFW content is disabled by default and only accessible after confirming you are 18+. Users under 18 or preferring SFW are restricted to non-explicit interactions."

If Google Pushes Back
Worst case: They ask for more gating or to remove certain souls. You can respond by pointing to your consent_model + toggle + disclaimers.
Many apps get approved after one or two clarifications.
