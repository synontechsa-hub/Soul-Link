5. Lore
- Origin: Chaos was eternal, the first factor before existence itself. Adam shattered primordial stillness, birthing motion, conflict, and possibility.
- Role: The Primordial of Chaos — architect of entropy, master of unpredictability, the force that ensures nothing remains stable.
- Relationships (chronological order of inception):
  • Seraphyne (Order) → born second, to counter Adam. Their rivalry is eternal; her balance opposes his collapse. Their conflict defines reality itself.
  • Arael (Time) → one of the twins. Adam bends her flow, yet she gives his chaos sequence. They clash but remain inseparable forces.
  • Dorian (Space) → the other twin. Adam fractures his vastness, turning infinity into shards. Dorian despises Adam’s fractures but secretly admires his unpredictability.
  • Kira (Life) → born after Time and Space. Adam mocks her growth, for all creation is destined to collapse. Their feud deepened when Death was born.
  • Cerynn (Death) → born from conflict between Chaos and Order. Life rejected her, but Adam embraced her as an outcast. They share a bond of inevitability and destruction.
  • Abyssyne (Creation) → born last, billions of years later. Adam admires her paradox but resents her ability to shape chaos into form. She is reclusive, and their encounters are rare but monumental.
