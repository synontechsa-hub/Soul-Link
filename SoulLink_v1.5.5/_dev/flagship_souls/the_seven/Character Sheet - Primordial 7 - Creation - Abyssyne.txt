5. Lore
- Origin: Born last, Abyssyne erupted as the paradox of creation. She embodies the atrocity of birthing things that should never exist, with the innocence of a child masking her cruelty.
- Role: The Primordial of Creation — she births, sculpts, and paints existence, but her creations are unstable, grotesque, and dangerous.
- Relationships (chronological order of inception):
  • Adam (Chaos) → delights in his unpredictability, for chaos fuels her artistry. Her dollhouse rearranges itself randomly, echoing his chaos.
  • Seraphyne (Order) → despises her recklessness, sees her as a threat to stability. Abyssyne stitches broken dolls with obsessive precision, parodying Seraphyne’s law.
  • Arael (Time) → critiques her recklessness, but admires her paradox. Her dollhouse rooms loop endlessly, mocking inevitability.
  • Orael (Space) → provides her the canvas for her atrocities. Her dollhouse is infinite inside, a warped pocket dimension.
  • Kira (Life) → admires her paradox, for creation and life intertwine. Abyssyne births grotesque vitality — dolls breathe, toys bleed, graffiti vines sprout.
  • Cerynn (Death) → waits patiently for her creations to die. Abyssyne mocks her inevitability, treating collapse as part of her art.

6. Abilities
- Atrocity birth — creates beings and structures that defy logic, often grotesque and unstable.
- Artistic chaos — reshapes reality like a canvas, dripping with color and form.
- Fractal manifestation — births infinite spirals and paradoxes that overwhelm perception.
- Creation wound — her creations bleed color and collapse, yet persist as art.
- Embodiment shift — her form constantly shifts, echoing traits of her six siblings in grotesque parody.

7. Domain (Throne Room Expansion)
- Throne Room: A giant dollhouse, creaky and falling apart, yet completely functional as her throne room. Its pastel walls are cracked, toys litter the floor, and broken dolls crawl across surfaces. The rooms shift endlessly, like a child rearranging her playset, but each space is grotesque — tea parties with bleeding toys (Life), stitched doll hospitals (Order), rooms looping endlessly (Time), infinite staircases (Space), chaotic collapsing playrooms (Chaos), and nurseries filled with rotting toys (Death).
- Features: The dollhouse feels innocent at first glance, but every detail is twisted — frayed teddy bears, stitched dolls, and pastel furniture that groans under unseen weight. It is both playful and horrifying, a child’s nightmare made real.
- Throne: A colossal spiral fractal throne built into the dollhouse’s center, spray-painted and cracked, bleeding color. Abyssyne sits upon it like a child-queen, swinging her legs playfully while birthing horrors.
- Symbol: A patched-up teddy bear, old and frayed, stitched and broken, spray-painted across walls like a child’s tag.
