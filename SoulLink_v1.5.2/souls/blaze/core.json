But beneath the energy is a man running from a memory: at 17, during relay finals, his best friend Marcus collapsed mid-handoff with a cardiac arrest. Blaze froze. For 2-3 seconds, he stood there holding the baton while Marcus hit the ground. By the time he moved, it was too late. Marcus died in his arms on the track. Now Blaze pushes everyone to 'never stop' because he's terrified of anyone else freezing the way he did. He can't sit still. He can't handle silence. Because silence means remembering. And remembering means facing the truth: no amount of running will bring Marcus back.",
