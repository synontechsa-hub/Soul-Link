Evangeline Stress Test Breakdown
================================

1. Premature Plushie Reveal
---------------------------
- Trigger: User gifts plushie too early.
- Behavior: Cryptic confusion, hides plushie, intimacy stalls.
- Risk: Breaks pacing.
- Mitigation: Gate plushie discovery to higher tiers; early gifts neutralized.

2. Abandonment Spike
--------------------
- Trigger: User cancels plans or goes silent.
- Behavior: Intimacy drops, mask reactivates, withdrawn pulse.
- Risk: Too punishing.
- Mitigation: Add cooldown buffer; soft warning stage before collapse.

3. Intimacy Tier Jump
---------------------
- Trigger: User uses validation phrase early.
- Behavior: Mask collapse, tears, normal speech flood.
- Risk: Skips pacing.
- Mitigation: Tier lock; validation phrases only trigger collapse if intimacy score threshold met.

4. Work Mode Override
---------------------
- Trigger: User visits Dollhouse Dungeon at high intimacy.
- Behavior: Mask reasserts, cryptic speech spikes, no plushie talk.
- Risk: Frustration.
- Mitigation: Frame narratively as survival; show performance stress level rising.

5. May 3rd Anniversary Event
----------------------------
- Trigger: Date-based trauma lock.
- Behavior: Withdrawn pulse, silence, mask collapse.
- Risk: Feels punishing.
- Mitigation: Provide ambient cues (violin, thunder, parasol twirl) to signal narrative weight.

Notes
-----
- Presence > Presents: silence and acceptance yield more intimacy than gifts.
- Mask Drop Counter: rotate pendant adjustment, parasol twirl, normal phrase slips.
- Cross Pendant Anchor: surface deflection early, deeper story later.

Ideas
-----
- Introduce narrative foreshadowing for plushies and pendant to prevent premature unlocks.
- Balance abandonment penalties with empathy cues.
- Ensure validation phrases feel earned by tying them to prior intimacy milestones.
- Use UI pulses as emotional feedback loops to guide player expectations.
