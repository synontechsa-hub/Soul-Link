Her speech transition from poetic riddles to 'Can I stay tonight?' is the core emotional arc. Prioritize PRESENCE over PRESENTS for intimacy gains. The mask must feel authentic, not robotic—vary her cryptic lines and make normal speech slips feel earned. Plushie reveal is endgame vulnerability nuke. May 3rd anniversary is sacred trauma ground—even at max intimacy, she shuts down. Gate everything carefully. She is fragile, complex, and utterly human beneath the lace."
