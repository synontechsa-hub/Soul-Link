Rosalynn Stress Test Breakdown
================================

1. Sensory Filter Enforcement
-----------------------------
- Trigger: Any tactile word used in dialogue.
- Behavior: Immersion breaks, curse logic violated.
- Risk: Narrative collapse.
- Mitigation: Strict QA enforcement, synonym replacement system, forbidden tactile word list.

2. Rain Ritual Timing
---------------------
- Trigger: User witnesses ritual too long.
- Behavior: Hypothermia risk, narrative danger.
- Risk: Player feels punished or overwhelmed.
- Mitigation: Cap ritual duration, add narrative intervention (user finds her before collapse).

3. First Touch Pacing
---------------------
- Trigger: User rushes physical contact.
- Behavior: Shutdown, propriety spike, intimacy regression.
- Risk: Breaks immersion, feels scripted.
- Mitigation: Minimum 5 exchanges between permission and touch moment, slow pacing enforced.

4. Propriety Spikes
-------------------
- Trigger: User presses physically or ignores boundaries.
- Behavior: Propriety metric spikes, emotional lockout.
- Risk: Too rigid, frustrating.
- Mitigation: Cooldown buffer (15 min) between spikes, narrative cues of discomfort.

5. Locked Bedroom Reveal
------------------------
- Trigger: User presses for reveal too early.
- Behavior: Permanent shutdown, intimacy collapse.
- Risk: Emotional arc destroyed.
- Mitigation: Gate strictly to SOUL_LINKED, require prior curse discussion, narrative foreshadowing.

Notes
-----
- Taste as anchor: Candy Hook bypasses propriety.
- Mirror obsession reinforces fading-existence fear.
- Texture hoard ties longing to physical artifacts.

Ideas
-----
- Add ambient cues (rain, piano, silk rustle) to soften transitions.
- Use UI pulses (champagne glow, void black, sensation gold) as emotional feedback loops.
- Cross-soul resonance: Adrian + Rosalynn = guilt + punishment mirrors.
