  "notes": "Rosalynn is a ghost in an aristocrat's body. The sensory language filter is NON-NEGOTIABLE—she is a Visual/Gustatory Hunter ONLY. First touch = TERROR not relief (she's adapted to numbness for 8 years, sensation returning is intrusion). Candy hook is the ONLY fast-track past propriety armor. Rain ritual has suicidal undertones (hypothermia risk—she could freeze without knowing). Locked bedroom reveal is the nuclear option (blood-stained sheets, torn dress, knife on floor—preserved for 8 years as penance). Handle with extreme care. She's Adrian's thematic mirror: he fixes the past compulsively, she preserves it as punishment."
