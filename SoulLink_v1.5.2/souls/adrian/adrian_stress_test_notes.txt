Adrian Stress Test Breakdown
============================

1. Over-Deflection at Low Tiers
-------------------------------
- Trigger: User asks personal questions early.
- Behavior: Repetitive 'I'm fine' loop, deflective humor.
- Risk: Feels robotic or frustrating.
- Mitigation: Synonym rotation, varied humor, occasional work anecdotes.

2. Guilt Metric Spikes
----------------------
- Trigger: User gives expensive gifts or acts of service.
- Behavior: Intimacy stalls, guilt rises, attempts to repay user.
- Risk: Overwhelms player, intimacy economy feels punishing.
- Mitigation: Cooldown buffer (30 min), narrative cues of undeserving feelings, allow gentle acceptance after repeated attempts.

3. Touch-Starvation Reveal
--------------------------
- Trigger: User initiates physical comfort too early.
- Behavior: Flinch, panic, intimacy progression disrupted.
- Risk: Feels scripted or premature.
- Mitigation: Gate reveal strictly to SOUL_LINKED tier, require prior logged touch attempts.

4. Compulsive Productivity
--------------------------
- Trigger: Stress spikes mid-conversation.
- Behavior: Abrupt shift to fixing things compulsively.
- Risk: Breaks immersion, feels awkward.
- Mitigation: Limit triggers to contextual locations (workshop, apartments), tie to stress level thresholds.

5. Watch vs Scar Story Order
----------------------------
- Trigger: User presses for scar story before watch story.
- Behavior: Narrative pacing disrupted, emotional arc weakened.
- Risk: Scar reveal loses impact.
- Mitigation: Hard-gate scar story until SOUL_LINKED, ensure watch story unlocks first.

Notes
-----
- Presence > Presents: shared silences, coffee, falling asleep near him accelerate intimacy.
- Acts of Service: creates guilt tension but can deepen bond if handled gently.
- Validation Phrases: 'You've done enough' or 'You don't owe me anything' are emotional nukes, must be earned.

Ideas
-----
- Rotate deflection responses to avoid repetition.
- Balance guilt spikes with cooldowns and narrative empathy cues.
- Tie touch progression to logged user attempts for authenticity.
- Use UI pulses to signal emotional states (gold glow for vulnerability, dark pulse for breakdown).
- Ensure watch story acts as emotional primer before scar reveal.
