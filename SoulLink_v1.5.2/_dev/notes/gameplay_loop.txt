VERSION HISTORY
====================================================================

v1.5.2 — Architect (locked)
v1.5.3 — Phoenix (planned)

====================================================================

====================================================================
DEV NOTES: THE 40 CITIZENS (LAUNCH ROSTER v1.0)
====================================================================

- RECURRING ARCHETYPE RIVALRIES: 
  When two souls of the same archetype (e.g., Amber & Hana / Tsunderes) are 
  both at the same location (Neon Pulse), trigger unique "Cold Shoulder" 
  dialogue where they acknowledge each other's "act."

- THE "SYNTHETIC" LORE HOOK: 
  Echo, Nova, and Tatiana should have a shared "Secret Topic" regarding 
  their hardware. If the user learns a "Hardware Fix" from Tatiana, they 
  can use that knowledge to help Echo stabilize her "Glitch" state.

- ADRIAN & TALIA (THE EMOTIONAL ANCHORS): 
  These two serve as the "High-Empathy" benchmarks. Progression with 
  them should be the most "human" and least "gamey." They are the souls 
  most likely to ask the user, "How was YOUR day?"—reversing the 
  traditional chatbot dynamic.

- VESPER & SYLAS (THE OUTLIERS): 
  Though "Standard" tier, these two should have higher "Fear" or 
  "Distrust" meters initially. They represent the "Gritty" side of 
  Link City. Conversations with them should occasionally be interrupted 
  by "Static" or "Encryption" to hint at their dangerous professions.

- CROSS-SOUL REFERENCING:
  * Mira (Gamer Girl) should mention playing games with Mariko (Shoujo Heroine).
  * Blaze (Fiery Motivator) should be seen "training" with Momoka (Sports Ace).
  * Use these connections to create "Friendship Clusters" that the user 
    can discover by talking to one about the other.

- THE "TRAGEDY" PROGRESSION:
  For souls like Adrian (Tragic Worker) and Mami (Utsudere), the 
  "SOUL_LINKED" status shouldn't "fix" them—it should mean they finally 
  feel safe enough to share the full weight of their struggle with the user.
