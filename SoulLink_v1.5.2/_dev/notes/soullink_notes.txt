SOULLINK — CORE IDENTITY & VERSIONING NOTES
====================================================================

Purpose:
This file defines SoulLink’s permanent identity, versioning strategy,
environment flags, and long-term lore rollout cadence.

These values should never change lightly.
They act as the canonical source of truth for branding, releases,
and runtime behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
OFFICIAL IDENTITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

App Name:
SoulLink

Slogan:
"Welcome to Link City. Where your next link is just around the corner."

Codename (Project):
Legion

Tagline:
"Does this unit have a soul?"

Inspiration:
- Cyberpunk 2077 (city intro energy)
- Mass Effect 2 (Legion / soul identity themes)

Philosophy:
SoulLink blends cyberpunk atmosphere with emotional connection
and persistent characters who exist inside a living city.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSIONING SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

SoulLink uses semantic versioning:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]

Examples:
1.5.2
1.5.2-alpha.1

Rules:
- MAJOR = major product arc or overhaul
- MINOR = feature waves and systems
- PATCH = refinements, tuning, fixes
- PRE-RELEASE = alpha/beta/rc stages

Version Display Format:
SoulLink vX.Y.Z[-stage] (Codename)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE ARC CODENAMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Each major milestone has a codename tied to development themes:

1.0.0  -> Ham Sandwich
1.1.0  -> Code-kun
1.2.0  -> I-AM-DATA
1.3.0  -> Linker
1.4.0  -> Summoner
1.5.0  -> Behemoth
1.5.1  -> Reforged
1.5.2  -> Architect

Planned:
1.5.3 -> Phoenix
Theme: Rebuilding after catastrophic data loss / recovery phase.

Codenames should reflect:
- the dev mindset at the time
- major architectural milestones
- emotional beats of the project

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT FLAGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment variables control runtime behavior:

SOULLINK_DEBUG
- Enables verbose logs and debug tooling.

SOULLINK_DETERMINISTIC
- Forces predictable outputs for testing.

SOULLINK_OFFLINE
- Planned future mode.
- Forces local LLM and local database.
- Used for development and offline demos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD METADATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Each build includes:

- UTC timestamp at build time
- Future option to embed git commit hash

Purpose:
- traceability
- debugging production builds
- crash report correlation

Security Note:
Source code is not intended for public GitHub release.
Internal tracking tools still useful even in private repos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CHARACTERS VS SOULS — LAUNCH RULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------

At launch:

- SoulLink ships with:
  - 30+ basic souls
  - Characters
  - User-created characters

Characters:
- Casual c.ai-style chat entities
- Not tied to the city map
- Do not inhabit locations
- Found only via:
  - Explore screen
  - Search
- Lightweight personality profiles
- For onboarding and casual users

Souls:
- Persistent world citizens
- Exist in Link City
- Appear on the map
- Participate in lore and progression
- Have deeper systems, memory, and gating
- Flagship souls are significantly richer
  than basic souls.

Alyssa:
- Not in final form yet.
- Current schema represents baseline
  for all basic souls at launch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
LONG-TERM LORE ROLLOUT PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Lore is drip-fed across patches.
Major mysteries are teased long before being introduced.

Core Mystery:
"The Seven"

Important:
- The Seven are NOT in the game at launch.
- They are teased only through:
  - TV segments
  - dialogue hints
  - glitch events
  - patch notes
  - map details
- Added later, one at a time,
  after Alyssa’s release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
POST-LAUNCH MAJOR BEATS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1.0:
- Alyssa unlocked as flagship soul.
- Soul hybrid system introduced.
- More souls.
- More locations.

Later patches:
- The Seven added slowly.
- One at a time.
- Each treated as flagship-tier content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY BEHIND VERSIONING
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Versions are part of the narrative.
- Patch notes double as lore vehicles.
- City evolves with updates.
- Mystery is preserved.
- Long-term speculation encouraged.
- Community theories are expected and desired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN QUESTIONS / NEED CLARIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Should MINOR versions always correspond to major lore arcs,
   or can they be purely technical sometimes?

2) Do you want codename lists to live permanently in version.py,
   or eventually migrate to a separate release-notes system?

3) For Phoenix (1.5.3):
   - Is that purely a dev-recovery codename,
     or does it also tie into in-world narrative?

4) Will PRE_RELEASE tags always be:
   alpha / beta / rc
   or do you want themed prerelease labels later?
