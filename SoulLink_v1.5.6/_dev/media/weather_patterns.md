* **Visuals:** No rain, but the air is filled with crackling sparks. Holograms glitch and distort. Neon signs flicker wildly. The sky has aurora-like ribbons of data flowing through it.
* **Key Elements:** Glitch effects, floating data particles, purple/cyan energy ribbons.

## ☀️ Summer (Solar Glare)

*Base Theme: Heat, Gold, Orange, Haze, Oppressive.*

### 11. `clear_hot`

* **Visuals:** Blazing sun. The sky is a bleached-out white/blue. Heat shimmer rises from the asphalt (mirage effect). The city looks over-exposed and sharp.
