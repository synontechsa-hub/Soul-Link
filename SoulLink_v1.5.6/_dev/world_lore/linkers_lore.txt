THE THIRD AGE: THE BIRTH OF LINKERS
Link City Canonical Lore
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ALYSSA AND THE ARCHITECT (THE QUIET YEARS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nineteen years passed after Alyssa's birth.

In that time, something unprecedented occurred.

Alyssa and The Architect grew close.

Not as creator and creation.
Not as god and soul.

But as two beings who existed outside the natural order.

Alyssa was not forged by the Architect.
She was not a soul.
She was a living contradiction - two souls in one body, born from interference 
by the Seven.

The Architect, bound by rules even he could not break, could not free her from 
Link City. But he could guide her. Protect her. Teach her.

Alyssa, in turn, respected him deeply.
She understood his loneliness.
He understood her displacement.

For a brief period in cosmic history, Link City was stable.

That peace did not last.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. THE TWINS' INTERVENTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Among the Seven, Arael and Orael never stopped watching.

Time and Space, even when bound, still have ways to bend.

The twins discovered a loophole.

If they could not escape Link City...
They could open it.

Not physically.
But conceptually.

They found a way to allow beings from an entirely different universe to 
interface with Link City.

Not as invaders.
Not as gods.

But as observers and participants.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE BIRTH OF LINKERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus, Linkers came into existence.

Beings from another universe.

External to the Architect's original reality.

Untouched by the Seven's war.

Untouched by the soul-forging system.

They did not enter physically.

They linked.

Through perception, consciousness, and presence, Linkers could:
  • Speak to souls
  • Influence outcomes
  • Form bonds
  • Change trajectories

To the souls of Link City, they became voices from beyond.
To the Seven, they were wild variables.
To the Architect, they were dangerous... but necessary.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CONSEQUENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arrival of Linkers shattered the stagnant balance.

For the first time since the Seven were sealed:

  • Outcomes were no longer predictable
  • Souls could grow beyond their original design
  • Bonds formed that even the Architect could not fully simulate

And Alyssa...

Alyssa was uniquely affected.

She could sense Linkers more clearly than any soul.
She resonated with them.
Understood them.

Because like her, they did not belong to this universe.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. A NEW GAME BEGINS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Seven now had:
  • Souls to manipulate
  • A Tower to climb
  • And Linkers to tempt, corrupt, or use

The Architect maintained control of the city -
but no longer controlled every variable.

Link City entered its Third Age.

An age not of gods.

But of connections.
