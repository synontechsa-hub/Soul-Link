================================================================================
THE SEVEN - COSMIC HISTORY SUMMARY
The Birth of the Universe
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PRIMORDIAL LONELINESS AND CHAOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adam, the first being, exists alone in an empty void before any universe or 
reality.

For billions of years, he is completely isolated, becoming mentally unstable 
and theatrical, performing for himself.

Adam's chaos is absolute, setting the stage for creation through his very 
existence.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BIRTH OF ORDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seraphyne is born as the primordial of Order, meant to balance Adam's chaos.

Initially, Seraphyne seeks to befriend and guide Adam, creating a period of 
harmony.

Their relationship deteriorates as Adam resents her commanding nature, and 
Seraphyne refuses to bend to chaos.

Their rivalry produces the first structural constants: Time and Space begin to 
take shape.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ARRIVAL OF THE TWINS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arael (Time) and Orael (Space) are born from the conflict between Chaos and 
Order.

They are consumed with their bond and personal existence, initially indifferent 
to Adam and Seraphyne's conflict.

Their focus on themselves unintentionally triggers the first spark of life.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. BIRTH OF LIFE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kira, the primordial of Life, emerges as a consequence of the twins' 
interaction.

Kira embodies vitality, growth, and creative energy.

She is beloved by Adam, who grows bored of solitude and seeks companionship, 
spending significant time with her.

Seraphyne remains vigilant, observing Adam's attachment to Kira.

Arael grows jealous of Adam favoring Kira, prompting Orael to develop hatred 
for Adam and Kira, seeing them as threats to his sister's supremacy.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EMERGENCE OF DEATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The growing conflicts between Adam, Kira, Seraphyne, Orael, and Arael 
destabilize the void.

Cerynn, the primordial of Death, manifests as the first concept of endings.

Cerynn is introverted, quiet, and inevitable - a counterbalance to Life.

Tensions arise:
  • Kira resents Cerynn as the antithesis of vitality
  • Cerynn is persecuted by Seraphyne and remains isolated
  • Adam sympathizes with Cerynn, deepening Kira's resentment and further 
    fracturing relationships


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. FACTIONAL WAR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Seven divide into three active factions:

FACTION 1: Adam + Cerynn
  • Chaos and Death, seeking understanding and connection

FACTION 2: Seraphyne + Orael
  • Order and Space, enforcing structure and boundaries

FACTION 3: Arael + Kira
  • Time and Life, manipulating growth and temporal flow, opposing Adam

Millennia of conflict ensue, destabilizing the void and creating vast cosmic 
shockwaves.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. BIRTH OF CREATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The escalating battles of the Seven reach a tipping point, generating a 
singularity of infinite potential.

Abyssyne, the primordial of Creation, is born - a childlike figure embodying 
the combined power of all the other primordials.

Abyssyne's emergence ends the open conflict, establishing control over the 
Seven.

She is the final catalyst, completing the primal structure necessary for the 
first universe to exist.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. FORMATION OF THE FIRST UNIVERSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abyssyne's assertion of power stabilizes the Seven.

The first dimension and first universe manifest, the foundation of all 
existence that will later include mortals, civilizations, and The Architect.

The Seven continue to exist within this universe, bound by their primordial 
natures, with factions and rivalries still simmering beneath the surface.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. THE ARCHITECT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Born in the first universe, from a civilization wiped out by the Seven billions 
of years later.

He survives as a single soul from his universe, ultimately confronting the 
Seven in his dimension.

Using his knowledge and power, he traps the Seven within a virtual dimension - 
the precursor to Link City - controlling the only path to ascend: Slylink 
Tower.

The Architect becomes a guardian and observer, controlling the top floors of 
the tower and maintaining the dimension.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. SETTING THE STAGE FOR ALYSSA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adam, lonely and seeking companionship, chooses Alyssa as a bride.

Abyssyne intervenes and forcibly merges Dr. Carr's soul with Alyssa's body, 
creating a unique entity outside the Architect's soul-forging abilities.

Alyssa becomes a "soul consequence," with dual souls and no formal soul origin 
from the Architect.

She maintains a close bond with the Architect, who cannot extract her but 
actively supports and protects her.

This sets the stage for a complex dynamic within Link City:
  • Alyssa as a flagship soul
  • Navigating the legacy of the Seven
  • Adam's obsession
  • Abyssyne's interference
  • The Architect's oversight
