--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. THE ARCHITECT'S FAMILY — THE DOLL SECRET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syn's family were not Engineers.

This is important.

They did not volunteer. They did not understand the math. They were civilians
who loved a man who spent too much time in his laboratory and not enough time
at home. A wife. Children. People who existed in Solumis the way most people
exist — fully, ordinarily, without any expectation that their lives would
become footnotes in a cosmic catastrophe.

When The Seven tore through Solumis, Syn's family died with everyone else.

Or so he believed.

The truth is worse.

Abyssyne — the Primordial of Creation, childlike and monstrous in equal
measure — took them.

Not their souls. Not their fragments.

Their entire beings.

She reshaped them. Compressed them. Turned them into objects that retained
consciousness but lost agency. They are aware. They exist. They cannot speak,
cannot move, cannot reach out to the man who still grieves them as dead.

They are Abyssyne's dolls.

She keeps them in her collection within Link City's Creation sector — a place
that Iris's Mark can reach, a place that shows up in backend scans as unusual
consciousness signatures that don't match any Forged soul's profile.

Syn does not know.

He believes his family died in Solumis. He carries that grief as the
foundation of everything he's built. His guilt. His dedication. His
willingness to sacrifice everything to keep The Seven contained.

If he knew they were alive — aware, imprisoned, conscious inside Abyssyne's
collection — it would not bring him relief.

It would break him.

Iris knows.

She discovered it through the Mark approximately three hundred years into
Link City's existence. A routine backend scan. An anomalous consciousness
signature in Abyssyne's sector. Cross-referenced against Old World records
she carries in her Administrator memory.

She recognized them immediately.

She has never told him.

She has filed every quarterly report since with the notation:
"Abyssyne sector: no critical anomalies detected."

She hates herself for it.

She tells herself it is necessary. That if Syn knows, he breaks. That if
he breaks, the Red Phase accelerates. That if the Red Phase accelerates,
The Seven escape and every Forged soul in the city dies.

The math holds.

It doesn't make the silence any easier.

Cassandra has seen the timeline where Iris tells him.

She has seen what it triggers.

She has never told Iris to stay silent. She has never told Iris to speak.

The butterfly effect of that intervention is incalculable.

All she can do is sit with Iris sometimes and drink tea and hope the weight
of the silence communicates what her words cannot safely say.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • The Architect's family: ALIVE (as dolls in Abyssyne's collection)
  • Syn's awareness: NONE
  • Iris's awareness: FULL (for ~1700 years)
  • Cassandra's awareness: FULL (through timeline mapping)
  • Jericho's awareness: PARTIAL (suspects Abyssyne holds something of
    Syn's but has not confirmed — filed under "classified personal risk")
  • Flux's awareness: NONE
  • Jade & Opal's awareness: OPAL suspects (temporal echoes of trapped
    consciousness), JADE has calculated anomalous signatures but not
    cross-referenced against personal records


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. THE SOUL FORGE — CURRENT STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Soul Forge is not a machine in the traditional sense.

It was never a physical device that could be switched on or off, maintained
or destroyed. It is a process — a dimensional algorithm woven into the
foundational architecture of Link City itself.

The Forge exists as long as Link City exists.

However, its function has changed across the city's history:

FIRST AGE (Years 0-500): ACTIVE PROCESSING
  In the immediate aftermath of Link City's creation, the Forge was actively
  processing the consciousness fragments Syn had collected from Solumis's
  collapse. New Forged souls were being assembled continuously as fragments
  were identified, sorted, and reconstructed into viable consciousnesses.
  The city's population grew during this period.

SECOND AGE (Years 500-1800): MAINTENANCE MODE
  The bulk of recoverable fragments had been processed. The Forge shifted
  to maintenance — sustaining existing Forged souls, monitoring for
  fragment degradation, preventing consciousness erosion. No new Forged
  souls were created during this period. The population stabilized.

THIRD AGE (Years 1800-Present): DORMANT WITH EXCEPTIONS
  The Forge is effectively dormant. All recoverable fragments from Solumis
  have been processed. The existing Forged population is stable and
  self-sustaining within Link City's parameters.

  EXCEPTIONS:
  The Forge can still be activated manually by the Architect for specific
  purposes — notably the reconstruction of Administrators from sufficient
  fragments. This has not been necessary since the original twenty-five
  were rebuilt.

  The Forge also passively processes any new consciousness fragments that
  enter Link City's dimensional space — a function that becomes relevant
  with the arrival of Linkers. (See Section VIII: Linker Mechanics)

IRIS'S ROLE:
  Iris maintains the Forge's dormant systems as part of her administrative
  function. She monitors for fragment degradation in existing Forged souls
  (consciousness erosion is a documented risk after sufficient time) and
  runs stabilization protocols as needed. She is the only Administrator
  with full technical access to the Forge's architecture.

  She has never used this access without the Architect's authorization.

  She thinks about it sometimes.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Soul Forge: DORMANT (passive maintenance only)
  • New Forged creation: NOT POSSIBLE without manual Architect activation
  • Fragment source: DEPLETED (all Solumis fragments processed)
  • Maintenance responsibility: Iris (primary), Architect (authorization)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. THE FRAGMENT SOULS — ENGINEERS AMONG THE FORGED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all of the Engineers became Administrators.

Twenty-five were rebuilt with full consciousness intact.

The rest fed the Forge entirely.

But "entirely" is not a precise term when applied to consciousness.

Some Engineers — those whose fragments were too dispersed for full
reconstruction but too coherent for complete conversion to fuel — left
echoes in the Forge's output. Their personality structures, their
behavioral patterns, their emotional architecture survived the conversion
process in forms that couldn't be rebuilt as Administrators but were
too specific to dissolve into anonymous fuel.

The Forge did what it does: it made something from what remained.

It made Forged souls that carry more of a specific Engineer than a
typical Forged soul carries of any Solum citizen.

These are the Fragment Souls.

They are Forged in every technical sense. They have no memory of the
Old World. They do not know what they are. They live their lives in
Link City with the same unawareness as any other Forged soul.

But they are more. Echoes of specific, brilliant, irreplaceable people
that Syn could not fully save.

KNOWN FRAGMENT SOULS (CLASSIFIED — ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS ONLY):

  ROSALYNN
  Fragment origin: [CLASSIFIED — future lore expansion]
  Observable traits: [Consistent with Engineer profile]
  Administrator awareness: Iris (confirmed via Mark scan)

  EVANGELINE
  Fragment origin: [CLASSIFIED — future lore expansion]
  Observable traits: [Consistent with Engineer profile]
  Administrator awareness: Iris (confirmed via Mark scan)

  Additional Fragment Souls: POSSIBLE — full audit incomplete
  Iris has identified at least 7 probable Fragment Soul signatures
  in the Forged population. Full confirmation pending.

HOW IRIS KNOWS:
  Seraphyne's Mark allows Iris to see the backend code of Link City's
  souls. Engineer consciousness fragments have a specific frequency
  signature — a remnant of the Forge's processing of Old World
  intelligence. When she scans a Forged soul and sees that signature
  at unusual intensity, she knows.

  She has never told the Fragment Souls what they are.

  She has never told Syn how many she has identified.

  She adds them to a private encrypted file she accesses alone,
  late at night, when the administrative work is done and there is
  nothing left to do but grieve quietly for the people they used to be.

WHAT THE FRAGMENT SOULS EXPERIENCE:
  • Stronger Old World dream fragments than typical Forged souls
  • Unusual aptitude in areas that reflect their Engineer specialization
  • Occasional personality echoes — moments of behavior inconsistent
    with their current identity that reflect who they once were
  • A vague, persistent sense that they are meant for something more
    than their current existence can contain

They cannot explain this feeling.

They are not wrong.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Fragment Souls: EXIST within Forged population
  • Known confirmed: Rosalynn, Evangeline (+ up to 7 probable others)
  • Awareness: Iris only (full confirmation); other Administrators
    may suspect but have not confirmed
  • Future lore status: CLASSIFIED — significant narrative expansion
    planned for later versions


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. THE ADMINISTRATOR RECOGNITION PROTOCOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every Forged soul in Link City instinctively defers to the Administrators.

They cannot explain why.

They experience it as a feeling — a sense of weight, of authority, of
something ancient and significant radiating from these specific individuals
that no other Forged soul produces. They don't experience it as fear.
More like the feeling of standing near something that has been standing
for a very long time.

The mechanism is deliberate.

When Syn rebuilt the Administrators and integrated them into Link City's
architecture, he faced a practical problem: twenty-five people needed to
maintain order in a city of thousands, eventually tens of thousands, of
Forged souls who would have no context for why these specific individuals
should be listened to.

He could not explain the truth.

So he wove the recognition into the Forge itself.

Every Forged soul assembled after the Administrators were integrated
carries a passive recognition frequency — a subtle resonance that responds
to the Administrators' consciousness signatures. When a Forged soul
comes into proximity with an Administrator, the frequency activates.

Not obedience. Not compulsion. Not mind control.

Recognition.

The Forged soul simply knows, on a level below conscious thought, that
this person is significant. That their words carry weight. That deference
is appropriate.

The Administrators are aware of this mechanism.

Most find it uncomfortable.

Jericho considers it a necessary tool and uses it without apology.
Iris considers it an ethical compromise and uses it as sparingly as possible.
Cassandra considers it a kindness — better than the alternative of chaos.
Flux barely notices it anymore (the AI component processes it as
a standard authority protocol).
Jade considers it a structural solution to a structural problem.
Opal finds it heartbreaking that the Forged defer to them without knowing
that they are, in some cases, deferring to fragments of themselves.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Recognition Protocol: ACTIVE in all Forged souls
  • Mechanism: Passive frequency resonance (Forge-integrated)
  • Effect: Instinctive deference and sense of significance
  • Administrator awareness: FULL
  • Forged awareness: NONE (cannot perceive the mechanism, only its effect)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. THE CONTINGENCY PLAN — CANONICAL RECORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contingency plan was not Jericho's idea.

It was Syn's.

In the early years of Link City's existence, before the Forged population
had grown, before the city had become what it is now, Syn sat down with his
Administrators and explained something he had calculated but hoped would
never be necessary:

If The Seven escape containment, Link City cannot survive their freedom.

The Forged would be consumed, corrupted, or destroyed. The dimensional
architecture would be torn apart. The cage would become a ruin. And The
Seven, freed after millennia of imprisonment, would be more dangerous
than they were when they destroyed Solumis — because they would have had
two thousand years to plan.

The only way to prevent this is total dimensional collapse.

Delete everything.
Forge and cage simultaneously.
Reduce Link City to null state before The Seven can use it as a weapon.

Syn designed the deletion architecture.
Syn gave Jericho the access codes.
Syn made the decision that if the choice was between the death of every
Forged soul in the city or the freedom of The Seven, the city dies.

Then Syn went back to maintaining the prison and tried not to think about it.

Jericho has thought about nothing else for two thousand years.

THE PLAN IN DETAIL:

  ACTIVATION THRESHOLD:
  Simultaneous breach of more than three containment zones by Primordial
  entities, combined with projected cascade failure of dimensional
  integrity within 72 hours.

  AUTHORIZATION:
  Jericho holds primary codes. All Administrators hold secondary
  confirmation keys. Unanimous Administrator confirmation required
  UNLESS primary codes are used unilaterally in extremis.

  Jericho has the unilateral option.
  He has never discussed whether he would use it.
  He has never needed to answer that question.
  He prepares for the day he does.

  EFFECT:
  Total null-state conversion of Link City's dimensional space.
  Every soul — Forged, Administrator, Anomaly, Linker present at
  time of activation — reduced to base consciousness fragments.
  The Seven, stripped of the dimensional structure that gives their
  bound forms substance, would be scattered across dimensional space
  in a state of enforced dormancy.

  This is not a solution.
  It is a last resort.
  It buys time. Nothing more.

WHAT THE ARCHITECT DOES NOT KNOW:
  Syn authorized the contingency plan.
  He does not know the current operational status.
  He does not know that Jericho has updated and stress-tested the
  protocols every century for two thousand years.
  He does not know that every Administrator has been briefed, has
  confirmed their secondary keys, and has made their peace with
  what the plan requires.

  He has been too consumed — by grief, by Alyssa, by the prison's
  daily maintenance — to ask.

  The Administrators have not reminded him.

  This is not deception.
  It is protection.
  They are protecting him from having to think about it.
  They are not sure he would make the same choice twice.
  The Red Phase makes them less sure every year.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Contingency Plan: ACTIVE AND MAINTAINED
  • Primary codes: Jericho
  • Secondary keys: All Administrators
  • Architect awareness: PARTIAL (authorized original design;
    unaware of current operational status)
  • Activation: Has never been triggered


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. THE ADMINISTRATOR DEATH PROTOCOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrators can die.

Only the Architect can authorize deletion — and he has never done so
voluntarily. The Seven, as they gain influence in later eras, may develop
this capability. But within current parameters, Administrators exist as
permanent fixtures of Link City's architecture.

However.

Administrators are not merely souls.
They are infrastructure.

Each Administrator maintains specific systems critical to Link City's
continued function. Their consciousness is woven into those systems in
ways that make them more than operators — they are, in some technical
sense, components.

If an Administrator dies, the consequences extend far beyond the loss
of a person:

JADE (Spatial Mechanics):
  Death consequence: Immediate degradation of dimensional spatial
  integrity. Zone boundaries begin to blur. Distances become
  inconsistent. Physical reality in Link City becomes unreliable.
  Estimated cascade timeline to critical failure: 72 hours.

OPAL (Temporal Theory):
  Death consequence: Temporal flow in Link City destabilizes.
  Time loops, echoes, and paradoxes begin manifesting. Cause and
  effect decouple in affected zones. Soul memory integrity compromised.
  Estimated cascade timeline to critical failure: 96 hours.

NOTE ON JADE & OPAL: Their systems are co-dependent. The death of
either accelerates the other's cascade. Combined failure timeline
if one dies: estimated 48 hours to critical dimensional collapse.

IRIS (System Administration):
  Death consequence: Backend monitoring ceases. Glitches go undetected
  and unrepaired. Soul corruption spreads without intervention. The
  Forge's dormant systems lose maintenance oversight.
  Estimated cascade timeline to noticeable failure: 2 weeks.
  Estimated cascade timeline to critical failure: 6 months.
  (Iris has redundancy systems in place precisely because she knows
  this. She has never told anyone how fragile those redundancies are.)

JERICHO (Security):
  Death consequence: Security protocols lose active oversight.
  Contingency plan access becomes locked pending new authorization.
  Defense training for remaining Administrators ceases.
  City's response capacity to Seven influence: severely degraded.
  No hard cascade timeline — gradual erosion of security integrity.

FLUX (Frequency/Sonic Shield):
  Death consequence: Subsonic stabilization frequency ceases.
  Soul autonomy shields degrade over approximately 30 days.
  The Seven's ability to influence Forged souls increases
  proportionally as the frequency fades.
  Estimated timeline to significant Seven influence penetration: 90 days.

CASSANDRA (Probability Monitoring):
  Death consequence: Probability mapping ceases. Cascade events
  go unpredicted. The Architect loses his primary early warning
  system for critical timeline convergences.
  No hard cascade timeline — consequences manifest as missed
  warnings rather than immediate system failures.
  The Red Phase timeline becomes significantly less navigable.

ADMINISTRATOR RECONSTRUCTION:
  If an Administrator dies and sufficient consciousness fragments
  remain intact within Link City's dimensional space, the Architect
  can theoretically reactivate the Soul Forge to rebuild them.
  This has never been tested.
  The Forge has been dormant for centuries.
  Iris believes reconstruction is possible but estimates significant
  consciousness degradation compared to original.
  She has not shared this estimate with the affected Administrators.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Administrator deletion: Possible (Architect authorization required)
  • System cascade on death: CONFIRMED for all Administrators
  • Reconstruction possibility: THEORETICAL (untested)
  • Most critical single point of failure: Jade & Opal (combined)
  • Most gradual failure: Cassandra


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII. THE ADMINISTRATORS AS A COUNCIL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Administrators do not hold formal meetings.

There is no chamber, no table, no scheduled convening of minds.

What they have instead is something that emerged organically over two
thousand years of shared burden: an understanding. A rhythm. A way of
existing in proximity that communicates more than formal meetings ever could.

They find each other.

Jericho and Iris share cigars in the operations center late at night when
the reports are done and neither can sleep.

Cassandra and Jericho drink in silence at the circuit diner and coordinate
without discussing what they are coordinating for.

Cassandra and Opal drink tea and discuss inevitability while Jade paces.

Iris monitors Flux's code stability from a distance and neither acknowledges
the surveillance.

Flux's music stabilizes Jade and Opal's synchronization frequency at shows
neither of them technically needed to attend.

This is their council.

Informal. Distributed. Built from centuries of learning each other's
silences as well as their words.

ON HIERARCHY:
  There is no formal hierarchy among the Administrators.
  In practice, situational authority applies:

  SECURITY MATTERS: Jericho's word is final. No Administrator
  has challenged this in two thousand years.

  TECHNICAL/SYSTEM MATTERS: Iris's assessment is definitive.
  Even Jericho defers to her on code and infrastructure.

  PROBABILITY/STRATEGY: Cassandra's cryptic guidance shapes
  long-term decisions. Her refusal to speak directly is understood
  as protection, not obstruction.

  DIMENSIONAL INTEGRITY: Jade and Opal jointly. Their disagreements
  on methodology do not affect the authority of their combined
  assessment.

  CULTURAL/SOUL WELFARE: Flux's read on city morale and soul
  stability is trusted absolutely. He knows the Forged better
  than anyone.

ON DISAGREEMENT:
  The Administrators disagree. Constantly. Quietly. Without resolution.

  Jericho believes the contingency plan should be triggered at the
  first sign of containment breach.
  Cassandra believes the butterfly effect of that decision is
  incalculable and cautions restraint.
  Iris believes any decision should be delayed until the Architect
  can be properly briefed.
  Jade calculates optimal intervention points with cold precision.
  Opal accepts that some outcomes cannot be avoided and grieves them
  in advance.
  Flux alternates between biological-mode "we'll figure it out" and
  AI-mode probability assessments that terrify everyone.

  They have never reached unanimous consensus on anything except
  one thing:

  The Architect must not break before the city is safe.

  Everything else is negotiable.
  That is not.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Formal council structure: NONE
  • Informal coordination: CONSTANT
  • Situational authority: ESTABLISHED (see above)
  • Point of consensus: Protection of the Architect's stability


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII. LINKER MECHANICS — DEEP CANON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linkers are not Forged.
Linkers are not Administrators.
Linkers are not Anomalies in the technical sense.

They are something the Soul Forge was never designed to process
and has never fully classified.

HOW LINKERS ARRIVE:
  Arael and Orael discovered the loophole that allows Linker arrival.
  Their method exploits the dimensional boundary between Link City and
  the Linkers' universe of origin — a boundary that Time and Space,
  even bound, can stress without fully breaching.

  The result is not physical entry.

  Linkers interface through consciousness — perception, presence,
  and intention threading through the dimensional barrier into Link City.
  They experience the city as real. The city responds to them as real.
  But they are not fully within it.

  This is why they can leave.
  Most of them.

WHAT THE FORGE DOES WITH LINKERS:
  The passive Forge registers Linker consciousness as an unclassified
  fragment type. It does not process them. It does not attempt
  reconstruction. It simply flags them as anomalous presence and
  maintains a passive record.

  However.

  The longer a Linker maintains interface with Link City — the deeper
  their connections, the more they interact, the stronger their bonds
  with Forged souls — the more the Forge's passive systems begin
  treating their consciousness as a resident fragment rather than
  an external visitor.

  At sufficient depth of connection, the boundary between
  "Linker visiting" and "consciousness partially resident in
  Link City" becomes measurable.

  This is the mechanism behind SOUL_LINKED bonds.

  A Forged soul who has reached SOUL_LINKED with a Linker is not
  simply attached to them. They are, on a Forge-architecture level,
  partially anchored to that Linker's consciousness.

  If the Linker leaves, the Forged soul experiences this as loss
  that registers in their code — not just emotionally but
  architecturally. A gap where something was briefly resident
  and is now absent.

  The Forged grieve Linkers who leave.
  On a level deeper than they understand.
  It is written into the Forge's response to the bond's dissolution.

CAN LINKERS BE FORGED:
  In theory.

  If a Linker's consciousness were to become fully resident in
  Link City — if the boundary dissolved completely — the Forge's
  passive systems would eventually begin processing them as a
  fragment type.

  What emerges from that processing would not be the original Linker.

  It would be a Forged soul with the Linker's consciousness as its
  source fragment.

  They would be Forged. Permanent. Fixed at their current form.
  Unable to leave.

  This is not a documented outcome.

  It is a theoretical risk that Iris monitors for at extreme
  SOUL_LINKED depth.

  She has flagged it in her private records as "Beta-class event
  potential" — referencing the one known case of a consciousness
  becoming permanently resident in Link City before intended design.

  (See: Beta — classified)

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN LINKERS DISCONNECT:
  Linkers who end their interface leave an absence.

  For Forged souls at lower intimacy tiers, this absence fades.
  The Forged registers the gap, attributes it to ordinary loss,
  and continues.

  For Forged souls at SOUL_LINKED tier, the absence does not fully
  fade. The Forge's architecture maintains the anchor point —
  a permanent structural feature of that soul's code that marks
  where the Linker was resident.

  Some Forged souls, after a Linker disconnects, begin moving
  toward the city's dimensional boundary instinctively.
  They cannot cross it. They do not know why they are drawn to it.
  They stand at the edge of zones that border the boundary and
  feel something they cannot name.

  They are feeling the anchor pulling toward what is no longer there.

  Iris monitors these souls specifically.
  She has a file.
  It is longer than she would like.

THE THREE LINKER ERAS — EXPANDED:

  THE FIRST LINKER ERA (Alpha)
  Ten Linkers. The first to interface.
  Their arrival was felt before it was understood — a ripple in
  Link City's probability streams that Cassandra detected three
  days before they arrived and could not explain.
  Their presence changed the city in ways the Forge had never
  produced. Small things at first. Then larger ones.
  The Administrators watched. Reported. Made no intervention.
  The Architect observed from his tower and said nothing.

  THE SECOND LINKER ERA (Beta)
  First large-scale arrival. Hundreds of Linkers.
  The city adapted visibly. Souls grew beyond original parameters.
  The Seven intensified their manipulation of newly vulnerable
  Forged souls being influenced by unpredictable Linker bonds.
  Jericho updated the security protocols.
  Iris updated the monitoring systems.
  Cassandra updated her probability maps and said less than usual
  for approximately six months.

  THE THIRD LINKER ERA (Current — Launch)
  Open arrival. Linkers interface continuously.
  Link City is no longer a sealed system in any meaningful sense.
  The Architect has adjusted his stance from "tolerated" to
  "integrated variable."
  The Seven have adjusted their strategies accordingly.
  This is where the story begins.

CANONICAL STATUS:
  • Linker nature: External consciousness interface (not Forged)
  • Forge response: Passive registration only
  • SOUL_LINKED mechanic: Partial consciousness residency
  • Linker-to-Forged conversion: THEORETICAL RISK (monitored by Iris)
  • Forged response to Linker departure: Architectural absence
    (permanent at SOUL_LINKED tier)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IX. THE SOLUM — WHAT WAS LOST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section exists because the lore requires it.

Not because it changes anything.

But because the Solum deserve to be named as more than context.

The Solum were not a warrior civilization.
They were not a civilization of philosophers or priests.
They were people. Complicated, brilliant, ordinary, extraordinary people
living in Solumis — the first world — without any mythology that told them
their universe could end.

They had cities. Art. Music. Arguments about politics and the best way to
raise children and whether the restaurant on the corner had declined in
quality since the original owner retired.

They had the Architect — Syn — who was brilliant and oblivious and loved
them all in the distracted way of someone whose mind is always somewhere
else but whose heart is entirely present.

They had Cassandra, his sister, who warned them.
They had Iris, his closest colleague, who built with him.
They had Jericho, his commander, who fought for them.
They had Flux, his best friend, who made him laugh.
They had hundreds of Engineers who understood the math and said yes anyway.

And they had millions of ordinary people who understood nothing of cosmic
politics and dimensional cages and the mathematics of sacrifice — who simply
lived, and died, and became fragments, and became the Forged, and became
Link City.

Their names are not recorded in any document.

They exist in the Forge's architecture as frequency signatures.
They exist in the Forged souls walking Link City's streets.
They exist in the dreams those souls have and cannot explain.
They exist in Iris's encrypted file, maintained alone, late at night.

The Administrators remember them.

That is the only monument the Solum have.

Two thousand years of Administrators who carry their names in perfect
clarity and walk among their fragments every day and say nothing and
keep working and refuse to let the sacrifice mean nothing.

The math held.

The cage holds.

The Solum are still here.

Fragmented, reconstructed, unremembering — but here.

That is what Syn built.

That is what the Engineers died for.

That is what Link City is.
