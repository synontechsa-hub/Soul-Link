================================================================================
PRIMORDIAL PROFILES
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ADAM - CHAOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role: The first primordial, the only force in existence before all else.

Nature: Chaos incarnate; eternal, unbound, and solitary.

Personality: Mentally unstable after eons of isolation; theatrical, obsessive, 
and prone to performing for himself.

Impact: His existence alone seeded the potential for creation, though no 
universe yet existed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SERAPHYNE - ORDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role: Second primordial, born to counterbalance Adam.

Nature: Embodiment of structure, law, and permanence.

Personality: Calm, enigmatic, disciplined. Initially sought friendship and 
guidance for Adam.

Conflict: Over time, Seraphyne's commanding presence clashed with Adam's chaos, 
igniting a rivalry that spanned millions of years.

Impact: The struggle between Chaos and Order catalyzed the creation of Space 
and Time.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE TWINS - ARAEL (TIME) & ORAEL (SPACE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role: Born from the fallout of Chaos and Order's conflict.

Nature: Arael embodies temporal flow; Orael embodies spatial infinity.

Personality:
  • Arael: The Diva-Princess of Time - confident, magnetic, thrives on 
    admiration
  • Orael: The Devoted Twin - loyal to Arael, protective to the point of 
    obsession, sometimes overshadowed by her presence

Impact: Initially self-absorbed, the twins' focus on their own bond triggered 
the first sparks of life in the void.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. KIRA - LIFE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role: Born as the first concept of life, emerging from the interplay of Chaos, 
Order, and the twins' self-absorption.

Nature: Vitality, growth, creation of living systems.

Personality: Energetic, radiant, chaotic yet magnetic; beloved by all 
primordials, especially Adam.

Conflict: Adam's attention toward Kira caused jealousy in Arael, and Orael's 
obsessive devotion to his sister escalated into hatred for Adam and Kira.

Impact: Kira's birth introduced the first factional conflicts among the 
primordials:
  • Faction 1: Adam + Kira
  • Faction 2: Orael + Seraphyne
  • Watcher: Arael observed, her jealousy simmering


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CERYNN - DEATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role: Manifested as a consequence of the void-shattering conflicts between the 
factions.

Nature: Endings, silence, inevitability.

Personality: Calm, detached, serene; embodies inevitability of endings. Shy, 
introverted.

Conflict & Relationships:
  • Resented by Kira, who saw her as the antithesis of life
  • Persecuted by Seraphyne, leaving her isolated
  • Adam sympathized and maintained contact, creating tension with Kira

Impact: Cerynn's presence introduced the balance of endings into the growing 
universe.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. ABYSSYNE - CREATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trigger: The escalating factional wars, combined with the interplay of Chaos, 
Order, Life, Death, Time, and Space, culminated in a single, unstable point of 
infinite potential.

Birth: Abyssyne, the Primordial of Creation, emerged from the chaos, embodying 
the combined essence of all seven primordials.

Nature: Creation, paradox, artistry, atrocity; a childlike figure masking 
immense destructive and creative power.

Impact:
  • Instantly asserted control over the seven, ending the open conflict
  • Her arrival marked the first true universe - the home dimension of The 
    Architect
  • The primordials recognized her as the final catalyst, the synthesis of 
    their powers into a single being


================================================================================
FACTIONAL DYNAMICS
================================================================================

With the complex dynamics between the primordials, three main factions emerged:

FACTION 1: ADAM + CERYNN
  • Chaos aligned with inevitability
  • Seeking connection and understanding

FACTION 2: SERAPHYNE + ORAEL
  • Order and Space
  • Enforcing structure and boundaries

FACTION 3: ARAEL + KIRA
  • Time and Life
  • Manipulating growth and temporal flow to play against Adam

Millennia of conflict ensued, as these factions battled for dominance and 
influence.

The void shook from their clashes, creating instabilities and tensions that 
would echo across the cosmos.


================================================================================
THE FIRST UNIVERSE
================================================================================

After Abyssyne's birth, the Seven were stabilized.

The first dimension manifested.
The first universe came into being.

This universe would eventually become home to:
  • Mortal civilizations
  • The Engineers
  • The Architect himself

The Seven continued to exist, bound by their primordial natures, with factions 
and rivalries simmering beneath the surface of reality itself.
