        "sensory_description": "The Circuit Diner glows in steady neon blues and pinks, its sign flickering gently against the skyline. Inside, vinyl booths line chrome-edged tables, and the scent of coffee, fried onions, and warm bread lingers in the air. During Morning, sunlight filters softly through half-drawn blinds. Afternoon hums with clinking cutlery and casual chatter. By Evening and Night, neon reflections dance across polished floors while the low murmur of late-night conversations blends with the hiss of the grill.",
        "crowd_atmosphere": "Morning draws early commuters and quiet regulars nursing strong coffee. Afternoon brings students, freelancers, and casual meetings. Evening shifts toward relaxed dinners and small groups unwinding. Night belongs to insomniacs, night-shift workers, drifters, and deep conversations that stretch past reason. During Home Time, the diner becomes calm and intimate \u2014 a sanctuary for those not ready to sleep.",

        "history": "The Circuit Diner opened during Link City's early infrastructure boom, originally serving construction crews working overnight shifts. Over time it became a cultural constant \u2014 a neutral ground where corporate workers, street-level freelancers, students, and wanderers could sit at the same counter without hierarchy. Many quiet revolutions and startup ideas were first sketched on napkins here.",
        "secrets": "Rumor has it the corner booth near the back wall is unofficially reserved. Some say a retired systems architect still monitors city networks from that seat. Others believe the diner\u2019s old analog wiring bypasses certain surveillance systems, making it one of the few places in Link City where conversations remain truly private."
