        "sensory_description": "Hidden beneath Skylink Tower, The Dollhouse Dungeon is accessed through an unmarked elevator requiring clearance or invitation. The space is low-lit and intimate, washed in deep crimson and violet light. Velvet-lined booths curve along the walls, and mirrored panels distort reflections in subtle, deliberate ways. Music pulses through the floor \u2014 slow, heavy bass during early evening and deeper, more immersive rhythms past midnight. The air carries notes of perfume, polished wood, and expensive liquor.",

Staff maintain quiet authority, ensuring discretion above all.",
