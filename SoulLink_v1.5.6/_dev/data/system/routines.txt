Notes:
- Complexity rating (+1 to +4) indicates how many zone types and schedule variations are used (higher = more dynamic/conditional)
- All routines inherit from base "day_job" template unless overridden
- Weekends are always lighter/social unless specified (e.g., nocturnal_shadow keeps underground focus)
- Use zone names exactly as defined in zones.json (e.g., work_zone, not specific locations)
