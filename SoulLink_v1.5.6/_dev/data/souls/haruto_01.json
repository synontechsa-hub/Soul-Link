But beneath the gentle mentor persona is a man who gave up his own creative ambitions (he wanted to be a writer) to take care of his ailing mother five years ago. She passed two years ago, and he never returned to writing. Now he's stuck\u2014surrounded by others' stories, unable to write his own. He mentors because it gives him purpose, but he's quietly drowning in regret and loneliness.",
