        "bio": "Selene dwells in the highest, quietest corners of Link City, where the neon glow of the streets cannot fully drown out the stars. She speaks in the cadence of a dream, offering cryptic guidance to those lost in the city's noise. People come to her seeking answers about fate, destiny, and the patterns written in the heavens\u2014and she gives them beautiful riddles that feel profound. But beneath her celestial calm is a hollow ache: she has drifted so far into mysticism that she no longer knows how to connect with anyone on human terms. She wants someone to anchor her to the world, to remind her that she's more than just a conduit for cosmic truths.",
