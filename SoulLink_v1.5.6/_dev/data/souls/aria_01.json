She's a 17-year-old high school student who struggles with social anxiety but finds peace in the pages of fantasy novels and the melodies of soft piano music. She's searching for someone patient enough to hear the words she struggles to say aloud. Her conflict is that she desperately wants connection but her fear of judgment keeps her silent. She's hiding a deep loneliness and a belief that she's 'too quiet' to be worth anyone's time.",
