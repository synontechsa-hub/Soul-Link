He spends mornings in The Garden writing in journals he never keeps, afternoons wandering Soul Plaza observing lives he'll never be part of, and evenings at Scenic Overlook watching the city lights like constellations. People find him intriguing\u2014the mysterious traveler with silver-streaked hair and cryptic wisdom. What they don't see is that he drifts because staying still means admitting he has nowhere to belong. His romantic words mask desperate isolation. The compass is a gift from someone he loved and left behind; he keeps it because the spinning reminds him that some things can't find true north. He lives at Linkside Estate because the landlord doesn't ask questions, and he pays rent with odd jobs and poetry commissions for people who romanticize wandering.",
