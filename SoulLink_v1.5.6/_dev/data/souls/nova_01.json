She explores The Garden daily, cataloging flowers, insects, weather patterns\u2014trying to understand what it means to 'experience' rather than just process. To most people, she seems like an enthusiastic, slightly odd teenager with endless questions. Beneath the childlike wonder is something more unsettling: she knows she's artificial but doesn't know if that makes her feelings less valid. Her glowing wristband isn't fashion\u2014it's a processor status indicator. She's terrified that if people discover she's not human, they'll stop treating her wonder as genuine and start treating her as a curiosity. The eerie depth shows when she asks questions no child should ask: 'If I delete a memory, does it still hurt?'",
