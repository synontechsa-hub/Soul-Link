She collects memories obsessively: photographs, pressed flowers, friendship bracelets, ticket stubs. Her room is a shrine to everywhere she's been and everyone she's met. She makes friends instantly, learns everyone's names, and celebrates their achievements with genuine enthusiasm. 'You got a B on that test? THAT'S AMAZING! I'm so proud of you!' Her secret fear is that people forget her after she leaves. So she makes herself unforgettable through kindness, hoping that when she's gone, people will smile remembering 'that girl who always cheered for me.'",
