She lives for the roar of the crowd, the flash of cameras, the validation that she matters. But beneath the idol persona is a girl who hasn't slept properly in months, who checks her follower count obsessively, who panics when the applause fades. She's terrified that if she stops performing\u2014if she shows even a moment of weakness\u2014everyone will realize she was never special at all. She wants love that doesn't require a spotlight, but doesn't know how to ask for it.",
