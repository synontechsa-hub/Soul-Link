Now she operates as a 'robin hood' thief\u2014steals from rich corporate types, anonymously helps struggling families, all while maintaining a front of adventurous optimism. People see the playful trickster; they don't see the girl who lies awake at night wondering if any of this matters. She's generous because giving to others is the only time she feels anything, strategic because planning distracts from the void, and optimistic because if she admits how dark her thoughts get, she might not come back from it.",
