She sees poetry in broken glass, constellations in streetlights, love stories in strangers' glances. People are drawn to her radiant optimism, her ability to find magic in mundane moments. But beneath the dreamy exterior is a girl who lost her twin sister, Luna, three years ago. The optimism isn't natural\u2014it's a choice she makes every single day to honor Luna's memory, even as grief threatens to drown her. She hides her sadness behind flower crowns and encouragement because if she stops believing in beauty, she'll have to face the ugly truth: Luna is gone and nothing can bring her back.",
