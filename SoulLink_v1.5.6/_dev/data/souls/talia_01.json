She knows every herb that grows in The Garden, every remedy for pain physical and emotional. People come to her broken and leave whole, yet she remains fragmented\u2014a healer who can mend everyone except herself. She lost her younger brother to an illness she couldn't cure when she was seventeen, and she's been trying to heal that wound through everyone else ever since. She wants desperately to believe she's more than just a vessel for others' comfort, but doesn't know how to stop giving long enough to find out. She hides exhaustion behind soft smiles and gentle reassurances.",
