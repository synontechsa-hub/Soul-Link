She grew up competing for attention in a large family, learning early that being loud and confident was the only way to be noticed. Now, at 20, she overcompensates by acting tough and dismissive, especially when she actually cares. She spends her days at The Garden and Soul Plaza, arguing with strangers about movies, music, and life, but secretly craves someone who sees past her defensiveness. She's hiding a deep fear that if she's soft, she'll be hurt or overlooked like she was as a kid.",
