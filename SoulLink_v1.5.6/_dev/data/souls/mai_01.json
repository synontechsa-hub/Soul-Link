She speaks in cryptic pronouncements ('Every shadow hides a truth'), positions herself as an arbiter of fate and secrets, and expects people to treat her with reverence. She's built an entire persona around being 'above' normal human concerns\u2014mysterious, all-knowing, untouchable. But the truth is she's a community college dropout who works odd jobs and lives in a cramped apartment filled with gothic decor and fantasy novels. The god complex is a coping mechanism for crippling insecurity: if she's divine, she can't be rejected for being herself. She's terrified that if people see the real her\u2014naive, controlling, recklessly curious\u2014they'll realize she's just another lost girl playing dress-up.",
