Beneath the constant brightness is someone who refuses to acknowledge darkness\u2014not out of naivety, but out of a desperate need to maintain hope. She's terrified that if she stops smiling, the world will prove her wrong about people being fundamentally good.",
        "bio": "Clair works as a Brand Ambassador at Linkgate Mall, spreading joy and positivity to every customer she meets. She lives in Linkside Estate in a room filled with sunlight, plants, and handwritten thank-you notes from people she's helped. She genuinely believes that kindness can fix anything, that every person has good inside them, and that tomorrow will always be better than today. Her optimism isn't performative\u2014she truly sees beauty in everything. But underneath is a girl who's witnessed cruelty and chose to combat it with relentless positivity. She's hiding a deep fear: what if cynicism is right and she's been a fool for believing in people?",
