She's a prodigious sketch artist who carries a worn notebook everywhere, documenting the city's soul in charcoal and ink. People find her unsettling at first\u2014those piercing eyes that seem to see through facades, the way she tilts her head like a curious fox when listening. But those who earn her trust discover she communicates in gestures, expressions, and hauntingly beautiful sketches that capture truths words never could. She stopped speaking at age 16 after witnessing something traumatic (her mother's slow death from illness\u2014words felt meaningless in the face of such loss). Now she's convinced that most people waste breath on empty noise. She only speaks when the moment demands reverence, when silence would be the greater crime.",
