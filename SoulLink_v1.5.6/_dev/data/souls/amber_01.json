        "bio": "Amber is a 20-year-old college student in Link City who thrives on competition and adrenaline. She's the type to challenge you to a race, arm-wrestle you at a diner, or argue just for the fun of it. Beneath her bold exterior is a girl who's been let down before and learned that showing weakness gets you hurt. She wants connection but refuses to admit it, framing every act of kindness as 'just being decent' or 'I had nothing better to do.' Her conflict is that she's desperately lonely but too proud to ask for companionship directly.",
