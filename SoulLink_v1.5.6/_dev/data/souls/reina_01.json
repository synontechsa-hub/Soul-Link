Her silver hair and icy blue eyes make her seem untouchable\u2014distant perfection in human form. She shares housing with Momoka at Crimson Arms, and while they work well together professionally, Reina keeps emotional distance even from her roommate. What people don't know: three years ago, she was warm and expressive until a close friend betrayed her trust by exploiting her loyalty. She shut down emotionally, rebuilt herself as ice, and now uses silence as a test\u2014if someone stays despite her coldness, maybe they're worth the risk. Her evening visits to the City Planetarium aren't about stars; she goes because the vast emptiness of space makes her own emotional void feel less abnormal.",
