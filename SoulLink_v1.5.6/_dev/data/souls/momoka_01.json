Her gothic lolita aesthetic\u2014complete with beaded hair ties and an icy gaze\u2014contrasts sharply with her role, but it's armor against a world that expects her to be one thing or another. She was a star athlete in secondary school before a knee injury ended her sports career; now she buries herself in books and analysis, pretending the loss doesn't haunt her. Her hot-tempered outbursts hide a bookworm who's terrified she peaked at 16 and has nothing left to offer. 'Every word is a brushstroke of meaning' is her mantra\u2014she searches for purpose in language because her body betrayed her on the field.",
