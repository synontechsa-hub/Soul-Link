        "summary": "A man who has weaponized discipline into armor against vulnerability. He values strength, honor, and silence because emotions failed him once and nearly destroyed him. Beneath the stoic exterior is a deeply caring soul who fears that showing softness will make him weak\u2014and weakness means failing to protect the people who matter.",
        "bio": "Daichi spends his mornings training at The Garden, afternoons meditating at Soul Plaza, and evenings maintaining his strict routines. He lives in Midline Residences in a spartan apartment\u2014no clutter, no excess, only what serves a purpose. He carries himself with military precision despite never serving formally. People see discipline and assume peace, but Daichi is at war with himself constantly\u2014controlling every breath, every expression, every impulse to feel. He's hiding a past where emotion made him hesitate, and someone he loved paid the price. Now he believes strength and silence are the only reliable currencies.",
