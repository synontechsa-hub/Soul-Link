        "bio": "Chiara is a 17-year-old prodigy who dropped out of formal education to pursue 'real science' in The Garden's makeshift lab spaces. She's loud, goofy, and theatrical\u2014bouncing between anime references and chemical formulas without missing a beat. Her workspace is controlled chaos: beakers bubble next to figurines, and her whiteboard is covered in both molecular diagrams and anime sketches. She's fiercely protective of those she cares about, often weaponizing her inventions to 'defend her pack.' But underneath the manic energy, she's foxlike and distrustful\u2014always watching for signs that someone wants to exploit her brilliance. She's been burned before by people who pretended to be friends just to steal her research.",
