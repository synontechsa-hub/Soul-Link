Most of her free time is spent gaming, streaming, or practicing mechanics just to stay sharp. She presents herself as endlessly energetic and competitive, but underneath that excitement is a quiet fear that if she ever slows down or stops being 'entertaining,' no one will really listen to her. Winning isn't about dominance\u2014it's proof she mattered in that moment. She works as a line cook at Circuit Diner to pay rent, treating the kitchen like speedrunning a game. Her biggest secret: she's desperately lonely despite thousands of online followers.",
