He works as a freelance minimalist designer (fashion sketches, architectural consultation, aesthetic curation for wealthy clients), maintaining an air of enigmatic elegance that makes him sought-after in Link City's upscale circles. People see him as the epitome of cool composure\u2014never rushed, never emotional, never messy. What they don't see: his black leather journal filled with chaotic sketches, emotional poetry, and designs that are anything but minimalist. He creates restrained elegance for others while his personal art screams with color and feeling. The silver ring on his right hand was his younger brother's\u2014the brother died five years ago, and Renji has been perfecting his 'untouchable' persona ever since to avoid feeling that loss again. He spends mornings in The Garden because organic chaos reminds him there's beauty beyond control, but he'd never admit that.",
