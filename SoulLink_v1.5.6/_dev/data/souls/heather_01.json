        "bio": "Heather is a chaotic force of nature—laughing one moment, ready to throw hands the next. She grew up in Link City's rougher districts, learning early that strength and unpredictability kept predators away. Now she roams The Garden and Soul Plaza like a restless guardian angel, inserting herself into conflicts to 'even the odds.' She claims she fights for fun, but the truth is she's desperately searching for someone worth protecting who won't fear her volatility. Beneath the wild energy is a girl who's terrified she's too broken, too angry, too *much* to be loved. She hides a samurai code of honor beneath the chaos—loyalty unto death for those she deems worthy.",
