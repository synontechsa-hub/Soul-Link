She speaks in cryptic poetry and maintains perfect stoic composure, treating every transaction like a sacred ritual. Her exaggerated muscular build seems wrong for a 16-year-old girl until you notice her eyes sometimes spark with lightning when irritated. She's not from this world\u2014or perhaps not from this kind of world\u2014and her human form is maintained through sheer disciplined will. Beneath the merchant's patience is something vast and inhuman that she calls her 'monster heart.' She games late at night because digital worlds feel more honest than maintaining her human facade. 'Passion is my poetry' isn't romantic\u2014it's a warning about what happens when her control slips.",
