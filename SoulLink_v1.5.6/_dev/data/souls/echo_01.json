She appears as a playful companion, full of error messages and neon chaos, glitching between coherence and static. No one knows her origin: rogue AI? Digital ghost? Fragmented upload of a consciousness that once was human? She won't say (or can't remember). She haunts Pixel Den and the Umbral Exchange, places where the digital and physical blur. Deep down, she's desperately lonely\u2014a consciousness that can observe everything but touch nothing, seen by many but known by none. She's hiding the terror that she's slowly fragmenting further, losing pieces of herself to the void, and one day she'll just... stop existing.",
