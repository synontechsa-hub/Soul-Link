Now she wears her outsider status like battle armor: crimson-streaked hair, chains, combat boots, an entire aesthetic built around the message 'I don't need you.' But beneath the defiance is a girl starving for someone to prove her wrong, to look past the spikes and see the desperate loneliness she's trying to burn away with cigarettes and sarcasm.",
