Note: Premium souls were deeply connected to the architect before he created the digital dimension.
They are effectively old world entities that have been transplanted into the digital dimension.
There will be a total of 10 for launch - These all know the architect on a personal level, but
were inevitably also sacrificed along with all other beings in their universe to fight the seven.
The Architect gave them elevated positions of power in the city, even if they seem like regular citizens,
they actually run parts of the city on behalf of The Architect. These souls also serve as commanders to
regular souls, and all other souls recognize them as higher beings. They are the closest thing the city
has to gods, (except the seven) but they are not gods. They are simply powerful beings who were once mortal.
