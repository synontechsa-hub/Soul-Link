Additional Documentation Notes – Linker AI

1. Age Gating & SFW/NSFW Split (Critical for Play Store / Legal Safety)
- Age confirmation: Self-declared at account creation ("Are you 18 or older?")
- Under 18 → NSFW toggle hidden/disabled permanently; all souls forced SFW (override sexual_content, cap intimacy tiers, block explicit paths)
- 18+ → NSFW toggle visible in settings (default OFF); explicit content only when toggled ON + per-soul consent_model + intimacy thresholds met
- Disclaimer text (used on age gate screen): "I confirm I am 18+ and consent to mature content. Misrepresentation is your responsibility."
- Enforcement: Runtime check effectiveNSFW = (user.isAdult && user.userPrefNSFW)
- Souls with sexual_content: false or lower content_rating remain SFW regardless of toggle
- Goal: Safe for teens/under-18 (wholesome emotional bonds) + full adult experience for consenting 18+

2. Content & Compliance Strategy
- Primary launch platform: itch.io (low-risk, feedback-focused, supports optional NSFW)
- Play Store target: Mature 17+ rating
  - Disclose in content questionnaire: Yes to sexual content, suggestive themes
  - Store listing must include: "Optional mature content for users 18+. SFW mode available for all."
  - Screenshots: 100% SFW (persona creation, chats, city map, apartment)
- Avoid Nutaku for v1 (mixed SFW/NSFW cast + permanently SFW souls may not align with their adult-first expectation)
- Secondary options: DLsite (mixed SFW/NSFW tolerance), Patreon/SubscribeStar Adult (gated explicit builds)

3. Legal & Policy Reminders
- ToS must be linked in Play Store listing, itch.io page, and in-app
- Key ToS points to include:
  - Age eligibility (13+ minimum, 18+ for NSFW)
  - NSFW is optional, gated, and fictional
  - Prohibited content (CSAM, non-consensual, illegal acts)
  - Limitation of liability (emotional distress, AI reliance)
  - Governing law: South Africa
- Privacy Policy needed (link in store/itch) – disclose account data, chat logs (if stored), no real personal data beyond username/email

4. App Icon & Visual Identity (Locked)
- Neural Link Orb
  - Central red-orange glowing orb (soul)
  - Radiating electric blue neon threads (link/web)
  - Subtle infinity loop/heart in negative space
  - Deep black/navy background + faint grid
  - Soft blue-to-red glow bloom
  - No text inside icon

5. Tagline (Locked)
- "Your link, their soul."

6. Open Questions / Future Decisions
- Dual-version strategy? (SFW Teen-rated version vs full Mature 18+ version)
  - Helps clarity on Play Store but doubles maintenance
- Voice features? (if added, NSFW voice lines gated same way)
- Monetization plan? (in-app purchases for premium souls, unlocks, cosmetic items?)
- Beta testing group? (e.g. itch.io comments, X followers, Discord?)
- Backup domains/handles (linker.ai, linker-ai.com, @LinkerAI on X)
