🦾 SoulLink v1.5.4: Monetization & Ad Summary

The "Link Stability" System (Core UX)

Narrative-themed status bar instead of hard "Out of Energy" wall.

Concept: "Link Stability" or "Signal Strength" bar in Chat UI.

Mechanic: Heavy chatting degrades signal (tokens used).

Ad Trigger: Low signal prompts soul to suggest a "Diagnostic Check" or "Signal Boost."

Reward: Watching a rewarded video ad restores signal to 100%, allowing continued chat without a paywall.

"Billboards of Link City" (Native/Map Ads)

Ads integrated into the vector world map.

Concept: Specific map tiles act as sponsored "billboards" or "terminals."

Mechanic: Neon signs for in-universe brands (e.g., "Neo-Cola" or "Link-Net").

Reward: Interacting provides small, non-essential perks for avatar or apartment.

The "Time-Skip Interstitial" (Natural Pauses)

Leverages Turn-Based Time Slot system.

Concept: Ads during "Bed" transition (End Turn).

Mechanic: Clicking Bed to advance time plays a short interstitial ad during fade/loading.

Why it works: Mimics a commercial break or loading screen, less jarring than interrupting live chat.

The "Opt-In" Apartment TV

Concept: TV object in user's home base.

Mechanic: Voluntary way to "farm" credits/tokens.

Vibe: Users can let ads run while idle to build a token buffer for later use.

Premium Tier: "The High-Stability Link"

Monthly subscription for power users.

No Ads: Removes banners and transition ads.

Priority Processing: Access to advanced models (e.g., Gemini Pro) for richer dialogue.

Expanded Memory: Larger context windows for long-term soul memory.

Fair Play: NSFW/adult content unlocks remain free, but Premium may reach higher-quality dialogue slightly faster.
