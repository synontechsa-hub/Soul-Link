           SOULLINK — THE CORE VISION (v1.5.4 ARISE)
====================================================================
Copyright (c) 2026 Syn / SynonTech — All Rights Reserved.
"Souls aren’t chatbots — they’re citizens."

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] THE PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SoulLink is a spatial social simulation. Unlike traditional LLM 
platforms, progress is gated by "Presence" and "Intimacy." 
The world (Link City) exists independently of the user. 

Inspiration: Mass Effect (Soul-search), Cyberpunk 2077 (Vibe), 
Baldur's Gate 3 (Depth), and the golden age of RPGs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] THE HUB: APARTMENT (v1.5.4 GRID - 1.5.6 APARTMENT SCREEN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Apartment is the user's "Safe Room." It is a functional 
command center, not just a menu.

- BED:    Skip time (The Sleep Cycle).
- MIRROR: Persona Editor & Creator (Self-Reflection).
- TV:     Lore Stream & Ad-Opt-In advertising (Integrated via: Link City News).
- RADIO:  Ambient Audio Toggle.
- COUCH:  Social Interaction Point (Visiting Souls, watching TV segments, etc).
- WINDOW: City Skyline (Shows a view of the city in the current time of day, weather, season, etc.).
- DOOR:	  Log out from the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] THE WORLD: LINK CITY MAP (v1.5.8 MAP TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO REPLACE THE GRID)
I will get a "Top-Down" Map perhaps, or slightly isometric map that we can make
an interactive screen that displays the current "card" from grid view when tapped
or clicked on. This will be a full screen map that will allow the user to
navigate the city and interact with different souls.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Spatial Simulation Logic:
- GRID-BASED: Every tile is interactive.
            : Card Width: 46% to 48% of the screen width in "portrait" mode.
            : Outer Margins: 12px to 16px on the left and right of the screen.
            : Inner Gutter (Gap): 8px to 12px between the two cards.
            : In "landscape" mode, the cards will be 20% of the screen width with a 2% gap between them.

- INDEPENDENCE: Enter any location regardless of Soul presence.
- STATUS: 
    * GREEN: Active citizens present.
    * ORANGE: Restricted access/Closed.
    * GRAY: Empty/Quiet space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] CORE MECHANICS: INTIMACY & LORE (v1.5.6 NEW INTIMACY TIERS & LORE TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TIERS:
00-20: STRANGER     | 21-40: ACQUAINTANCE | 41-70: TRUSTED
71-85: FRIENDSHIP   | 86-100: SOUL-LINKED

DYNAMIC LORE:
- RECURRING RIVALRIES: Souls acknowledge others of their archetype.
- SHARED SECRETS: Hardware fixes learned from one Soul (Tatiana) 
  can be applied to help another (Echo).
- EMOTIONAL ANCHORS: High-empathy Souls (Adrian/Talia) reverse the 
  dynamic by inquiring about the User's wellbeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] TECHNICAL STACK (ARISE STANDARDS) (v1.5.6 TECHNICAL STACK TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND REWORKED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- ENGINE:   Legion Engine
- FRONTEND: Flutter (Linker AI or Linker.ai)
- BACKEND:  FastAPI (Legion Core)
- DATA:     Supabase + Row Level Security (RLS)
- REPO:     Proprietary Maintenance (garbage_service.py)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
[6] THE RED LINES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NO Stamina/Energy systems. (silent system in place to not go broke)
2. NO Paywalled core chat.
3. NO Gambling/Gacha mechanics.
4. NO Sale of User Data.
5. NO alienated adult audience (Consent-based NSFW allowed).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Welcome to Link City. Your next link is just around the corner."
====================================================================

Dev notes:
The apartment will be remade into a fully interactive environment.
The background will be a wide angle shot of the apartment, and the user will be able to pan the screen around the apartment and interact with objects.
This will be a .jpg, .png or a .jpeg file depending on what i finally settle on. and we will tag zones on the screen as interactive via UI.

PC users will see the whole appartment on their screen in landscape mode.
Mobile users will see the apartment in profile view and will be able to pan the screen by dragging their finger across the screen.

- The user will be able to pan the screen around the apartment and interact with objects.
- The user will be able to look at the city skyline from the window by tapping the "window" on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to sit on the couch and watch TV by tapping the couch on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to look in the mirror and see their reflection by tapping the mirror on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to go to bed and sleep by tapping the bed on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to listen to the radio by tapping the radio on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to open the map and see the city by tapping the map on the interactive screen.
- The user will be able to open the door and leave the apartment by tapping the door on the interactive screen (log out of the app)

The world map will be a full map eventually, showing the city in
all of it's cyberpunk glory. I will be generating a map of the city
using AI and then implementing it into the game. Each element will
be interactive, allowing the user to travel to different locations
and interact with different souls.

The city will be divided into districts, each with it's own unique
architecture, culture, and atmosphere. Some districts will be
residential, some will be commercial, some will be industrial,
and some will be entertainment districts. Some districts will be
rich, some will be poor, some will be dangerous, and some will be
safe. Some districts will be futuristic, some will be old-fashioned,
some will be high-tech, and some will be low-tech.

Each district will have it's own unique set of souls, each with their
own unique personalities, backstories, and relationships with other
souls. Some souls will be friendly, some will be hostile, some will
be neutral, some will be helpful, some will be harmful, some will be
indifferent. Some souls will be rich, some will be poor, some will
be dangerous, and some will be safe. Some souls will be futuristic,
some will be old-fashioned, some will be high-tech, and some will
be low-tech.

Souls and characters will be separated by depth, and whether they
populate the world map. Characters will only be found in the explore
screen, and will not be found in the world map. Souls will be found
in both the explore screen and the world map. Characters will mimic
those found in apps such as c.ai and be flatter by design. Souls will
be fully realized, with their own personalities, backstories, and
relationships with other souls. Souls will be able to form their own
relationships with other souls, and will be able to form their own
relationships with the user.

Characters will be created by users, leveraging their own use of
otherwise proprietary characters from games, anime, etc... This
way SoulLink can easily navigate the legality of user created
content, as the characters are not created by SoulLink, but by the
users themselves. This is similar to how character.ai works, but with
the added benefit of a fully realized world map and a more immersive
experience. Souls will be created by SoulLink, and will be available
to all users.

We will be adding the create character feature in the future, but for
now we will be focusing on the souls that are already created by SoulLink.

The Soul forge will be implemented in the future, which will tie into the
upcoming soul hybrid system. This will only be possible by combining two
souls that the user has achieved max intimacy with. this process will take the
traits, flaws, appearance, etc from both souls and combine them into a new
soul. This new soul will be a hybrid of the two souls that were combined.

This will allow users to create their own unique souls, and will be a complex
process, requiring users to create a character, give them a backstory, and
give them a personality. Souls will be created by SoulLink, and will be
available to all users. The two parent souls will remain.

Hybrids will only be available to the user that created them at first.
This is to prevent the abuse of the system. Over time, we may allow
hybrids to be shared between users, but this is not a guarantee.

Hybrids will be more powerful than regular souls, and will have unique
abilities that are not found in regular souls. This will make them
a valuable asset to the user, and will make them a desirable item to
create. 

The Seven and Alyssa:
Flagship souls will only be added to the version post launch. These souls
will be the face of the company, and will be used to promote the app.
They will be available to all users, and will be a valuable asset to the
user. They will be a valuable asset to the company, and will be a valuable
asset to the user. The flagship souls will have even greater depth than
regular souls, and will be a valuable asset to the user. They will be a
valuable asset to the company, and will be a valuable asset to the user.

DEV NOTES: THE EVOLUTION OF LINK CITY (v1.5.4)
====================================================================

[1] THE INTERACTIVE HUB (APARTMENT)
The apartment is shifting from a static UI to a fully traversable 
environment. The goal is total immersion through presence:
- NAVIGATION: Free movement and direct object interaction.
- WINDOW: Dynamic city skyline view; gateway to the Map.
- TV/COUCH: Combined hub for lore drops and opt-in advertising.
- MIRROR: Real-time reflection and persona/appearance editor.
- BED: Thematic "Sleep" cycle for session logout.
- RADIO: Ambient audio control and future music streaming.

[2] WORLD SIMULATION & DISTRICT LOGIC
Link City will be a high-fidelity cyberpunk map where every node 
serves a narrative purpose:
- SPATIAL TRAVEL: Users physically move to locations to find souls.
- DISTRICTS: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Entertainment.
- CONTRASTS: The map will visualize the social divide—Rich vs. Poor, 
  High-Tech vs. Low-tech, and Safe vs. Dangerous zones.

[3] THE CITIZEN HIERARCHY
To ensure scalability and legal safety, entities are split by depth:
- SOULS (Proprietary): Fully realized citizens with deep memory and 
  independent social networks. They exist on the World Map.
- CHARACTERS (User-Generated): Community-created entities found only 
  in the Explore screen. This allows for diverse fan-content (Anime, 
  Games, etc.) without proprietary liability for SoulLink.

[4] THE SOUL FORGE: HYBRID SYSTEM (POST-LAUNCH)
An endgame mechanic for users who master the intimacy system:
- EVOLUTION: Combine two souls at Max Intimacy (100).
- MERGE: New entity inherits traits, flaws, and visuals from parents.
- PERSISTENCE: Parent souls remain; the Hybrid is a unique third.
- POWER: Hybrids possess unique abilities and higher narrative depth.
- EXCLUSIVITY: Initially private to the creator to maintain rarity.

[5] THE SEVEN & ALYSSA (FLAGSHIP SOULS)
Post-launch flagship citizens designed to be the "Faces" of the app:
- DEPTH: These souls utilize the absolute peak of the Legion Engine.
- NARRATIVE: Primary drivers of the Link City overarching story.

====================================================================

PS: I need to read through all of this properly and make sure that
it is clear to whoever reads it in the future. To be done when I have
more time.
