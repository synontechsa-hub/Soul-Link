# SoulLink — Unified Vision Manifest (v1.5.6)
>
> "Souls aren’t chatbots — they’re citizens."

---

## 1. The Philosophy

SoulLink is a spatial social simulation where progress is gated by **Presence** and **Intimacy**. Unlike traditional LLM platforms, the world (Link City) exists independently of the user, with souls following their own routines and social webs.

**Inspiration**: Mass Effect (Depth), Cyberpunk 2077 (Vibe), and Baldur's Gate 3 (Narrative Agency).

---

## 2. Branding & Identity

* **App Name**: Linker AI (Linker.ai)
* **Tagline**: "Your link, their soul."
* **User Role**: The **Linker** (Active agents initiating connections).
* **NPC Role**: **Souls** (Adaptive, persistent inhabitants of Link City).
* **App Icon**: **Neural Link Orb** (Red-orange core with radiating electric blue neon threads on a matte black grid).

### Branding Guardrails

* **Intimacy First**: Souls are never called "bots" or "tools".
* **Agency**: Linkers initiate, but do not control souls.
* **Mystery**: Intentional atmospheric depth; avoid over-explanation.
* **Human-First**: High-tech aesthetic serving emotional connection.

## 3. Core Mechanics

### The Apartment (User Hub)

The user's safe room and command center.

* **Bed**: Sleep cycle / Session Logout.
* **Mirror**: Persona Editor & Creator.
* **TV**: Lore Stream & Opt-in rewarded ads (Link City News).
* **Radio**: Ambient audio toggle & Lore broadcasts.
* **Couch**: Social interaction point for visiting souls.
* **Window**: Dynamic city skyline view; link to the World Map.

### The World Map (Link City)

A spatial navigation layer with district-based logic.

* **Districts**: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Entertainment (Rich vs. Poor).
* **Status**:
  * **Cyan**: Linked Soul present.
  * **Grey**: Unlinked Soul present (Radar detection).
  * **Locked**: Restricted access or closed hours.

### Intimacy & Relationship

Standardized 3-tier system:

1. **STRANGER** (0-40)
2. **TRUSTED** (41-85)
3. **SOUL-LINKED** (86-100)

---

## 4. Technical Foundations (Legion Engine)

* **Context Awareness**: Souls are locked to their DB location state (Spatial Anchoring).
* **Persistence**: Memory systems track summaries, milestones, and preferences.
* **Consent Model**: Gated NSFW content based on user age (18+) and intimacy tier.
* **Hybrid System (Post-Launch)**: The "Soul Forge" allows merging two max-intimacy souls into a third unique entity.

---

## 5. Monetization Strategy

Focus on non-intrusive, theme-aligned revenue.

* **Link Stability**: Narrative-themed decay of signal strength during chat, restored via rewarded ads (Diagnostic Check).
* **Opt-In TV**: Voluntary ad viewing in the apartment for energy/token buffers.
* **Native Billboards**: Sponsored neon signs in the world map for non-essential perks.
* **Premium Tier (Quantum Link)**:
  * Unlimited stability (No ads).
  * Priority processing (Advanced LLM models).
  * Expanded memory (Larger context windows).

---

## 6. The Red Lines (Non-Negotiable)

1. **NO Hard Paywalls**: Core chat remains accessible.
2. **NO Gacha/Gambling**: Progression is earned through interaction.
3. **NO Data Selling**: User privacy is paramount.
4. **NO Forced Content**: All mature content is opt-in and age-gated.
